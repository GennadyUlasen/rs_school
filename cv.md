### About me:
***
I want to work in IT, because I like study and develop new skills in yourself. I have a technical education and I'm just very determined. I spend all my free time on self-education.

I plan to further develop in Front-end development, as I like working with data visualization. In this area, I see the potential for developing my skills as a programmer, designer, as well as the opportunity to improve my English.

**Example from CODEWARS:**  *Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.  
Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.*
```function paperwork(n, m) {
  if(n<0 || m<0) {
    return 0
  }
  else if(n>0 || m>0){
